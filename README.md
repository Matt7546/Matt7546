<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª IT Projects:</h2>

- 7/25 [Host Based Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/Matt7546/threat-intel-dashboard) (In Progress)
  - Developed a Python-based threat intelligence dashboard that pulls live indicator data from open sources and maps findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Integrated network log analysis and intrusion detection to identify and alert on potential threats in real time. The project demonstrates expertise in open-source threat feeds, automated intrusion detection, log correlation, and security monitoring.
 
- 5/24 [AI Anomoly Detection](https://github.com/matt7546/LLMSupportedProgramRepair) 
  - LLMSupportedProgramRepair is a hands-on project focused on detecting, analyzing, and interactively repairing real-world software vulnerabilities using automated tools and large language models (LLMs). The project covers setup and use of the bugscpp framework, working with code examples related to common weaknesses like CWE-835, CWE-190, and CWE-125, and guiding LLMs to identify and fix bugs without revealing the solutions directly. Through both curated test cases and real-world projects, ProgramRepair builds practical skills in secure coding, debugging, and automated vulnerability remediation.


<h2>üìÑ ResearchPapers</h2>


- 7/25 [2016 Uber Data Breach Analysis](https://github.com/Matt7546/Documents/blob/main/Uber_Data_Breach_Analysis_Matthew_Thomas.pdf)
  - This case study examines the 2016 Uber data breach and its root causes, including weak security controls and poor incident response. It outlines the consequences Uber faced and the critical lessons learned about data protection. This analysis emphasizes the need for strong encryption, employee training, and transparent breach disclosure.
